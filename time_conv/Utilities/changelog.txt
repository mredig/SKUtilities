Version 1.3
	Features
	- can now add values to points (x+v, y+v)
	- added SKMasterButton class
		- platform agnostic buttons!
	- added SKUMultiLineLabelNode class
	- added SKScene ability to consolidate input methods
		- overwrote default ignoring of right click and other mouse clicks
	- added deltaMaxTime (defaults to 1.0f) to avoid abrupt spikes in delta time due to lag or being the first time the method is called
	- added CGPoint to object conversion (and back) (easier cross platform storage for arrays and dicts)
	- added vectorMultiply method
	- added pointBFromPointA withVector method
	- added random number generator convenience methods
	- added linear interpolation for float values
	- added reverse linear interpolation for float values


	Bug Fixes
	- renamed kPhone4Scale to kPhoneFromPadScale_SKUTIL 
		- also added kPadToPhoneScale_SKUTIL, kPhoneToPadScale_SKUTIL, kPadFromPhoneScale_SKUTIL
	- moved property of radiansToDegreesConversionFactor and degreesToRadiansConversionFactor to macros and can be used as "kDegToRadConvFactor_SKUTIL" and "kRadToDegConvFactor_SKUTIL"

	Known Issues
	- parsing durations from seconds doesn't work yet
	- apologies for the inconsistent class naming schemes... I am very finicky on what to name them!
	

Version 1.2
	Features
	- the previous version optimized the distance calculation, but no note was made in the previous notes
	- changed _previousFrameDuration to be named _deltaFrameTime
	- created an error log if calling a point step function without any delta time input
	- added value ramping

Version 1.1

	Features
	- added "-(NSDictionary*)calculateDurationsFromSeconds:(CFTimeInterval)seconds"
	- added ability to globally track time intervals to avoid the need to always pass time intervals into update functions 
		-@property (nonatomic, readonly) CFTimeInterval currentTime;
		-@property (nonatomic, readonly) CFTimeInterval previousFrameDuration;
	- added vector utilities
		- normalization
		- adding
		- subtracting
		- vector between origin and destination
		- convert from point
	- added point utilities
		- add points together
		- convert from vector
		- step movement functions
			- towards point
			- using vector
