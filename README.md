Utilities for SpriteKit

Intended to be an easy resource for SpriteKit projects to get quick access to common functions. What's easiest? Manually typing in your distance equation every time, creating your own convenience method, or having it already created for you so all you have to do is call the method and input your coordinates? 

Note: I am a relatively new programmer, so it's entirely possible I haven't made everything in the neatest, tidiest way. I may not have optimized everything to the best it can be. There may be better, or MUCH better ways of doing these things. However, I am creating this because I have found a use for them and figure others may be able to benefit too. Please don't judge! 

Requirements:
